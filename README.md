I use [doom-emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) now and you may want to as well.

# my emacs config

So, this is my emacs configuration. You might find it useful. Maybe
not. I recently moved everything to el-get so I figured it was a good
time to put this under version control.

If for whatever reason you would like to take this for a spin, just
clone this repo to your ~/.emacs.d

and then run emacs, it will probably take a few times to install everything.
